# AWS Media Processing and Highlights Fetcher

This repository contains two Python scripts for managing media content and sports highlights using AWS services.

## Overview

1. **`fetch.py`:** Fetches sports highlights from an external API and stores the data in an AWS S3 bucket.
2. **`mediaconvert_process.py`:** Processes videos stored in an S3 bucket using AWS MediaConvert.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure you have the following set up:

1. **AWS Services**:
   - S3 Bucket for storing files.
   - AWS MediaConvert for video processing.
   - Proper IAM roles with sufficient permissions.

2. **Python Libraries**:
   - `boto3`
   - `requests`

3. **Configuration**:
   Create a `config.py` file in the project directory with the following variables:
   ```python
   API_URL = "<Your API URL>"
   RAPIDAPI_HOST = "<Your RapidAPI Host>"
   RAPIDAPI_KEY = "<Your RapidAPI Key>"
   DATE = "<Target Date for Highlights>"
   LEAGUE_NAME = "<League Name>"
   LIMIT = "<Number of Highlights>"
   S3_BUCKET_NAME = "<Your S3 Bucket Name>"
   AWS_REGION = "<Your AWS Region>"
   MEDIACONVERT_ENDPOINT = "<Your MediaConvert Endpoint URL>"
   MEDIACONVERT_ROLE_ARN = "<Your MediaConvert Role ARN>"
   ```

## Scripts

### 1. Fetch Highlights Script (`fetch.py`)

#### Purpose:
Fetches sports highlights from an API and saves them as JSON files in an S3 bucket.

#### Key Features:
- Retrieves highlights using API query parameters (date, league, etc.).
- Automatically creates the specified S3 bucket if it doesn't exist.
- Stores the fetched highlights in the `highlights/` folder within the bucket.

#### Usage:
Run the script directly:
```bash
python fetch.py
```

---

### 2. MediaConvert Processing Script (`mediaconvert_process.py`)

#### Purpose:
Processes videos stored in an S3 bucket using AWS MediaConvert and saves the output to a designated folder.

#### Key Features:
- Processes videos with customizable settings (e.g., codec, bitrate, etc.).
- Saves processed videos to the `processed_videos/` folder in the S3 bucket.
- Outputs detailed job information for debugging.

#### Usage:
Run the script directly:
```bash
python mediaconvert_process.py
```

## Notes

- Ensure your AWS credentials are configured in your environment (`~/.aws/credentials` or using environment variables).
- API and AWS-specific variables should be securely stored in the `config.py` file.
- These scripts assume proper setup of AWS MediaConvert and S3 services.
